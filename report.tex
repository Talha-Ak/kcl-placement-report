\section*{Abstract}

My year in industry was spent abroad in Istanbul, Turkey, for the company ILITRON\@. I began the
placement initially working as a \enquote{Research Assistant}, later taking on a more general
\enquote{Software Engineer} role. A wide variety of projects were worked on through the placement,
both academic and industrial in nature, covering numerous areas of software development.

A key project of the placement includes co-authoring a research paper, where extensive
experimentation and analysis was essential to validate the theory of the paper. This required skills
acquired from university, as well as enhancing understanding of reinforcement learning theory.
Another key project was assisting development of a library used to control robotic arms, where
thorough testing in simulation and real-life was crucial. This involved developing for an area I had
no prior experience with, requiring extensive collaboration with colleagues to create a working
solution.

These projects helped to improve technical skills, such as performing data analysis in Python,
writing performant C++, and developing and deploying web applications. The experience also improved
soft skills, such as time management, general organisational skills, as well as effective workload
prioritisation.

Completing the placement had allowed me to discover areas of interest, identify and improve areas of
weakness, as well as clarifying the next steps I wish to take in my career.

\chapter{Conclusion}

My placement at ILITRON provided me with valuable experiences in both industry and academic spheres,
furthering knowledge in areas including reinforcement learning, web development, software
architecture and design, and project management. It also helped further soft skills such as time
management, organisational skills, and collaborative skills.

Working abroad provided the opportunity to experience different backgrounds and cultures in both
professional and casual settings, providing an insight into the future benefits and challenges of
working abroad if I were to do so.

Most importantly, this placement has helped shape the future I intend to pursue by highlighting
areas of interest like machine learning, as well as providing a motivation to further my education
before entering industry in the form of a Master's.
