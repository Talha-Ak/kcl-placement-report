\chapter{Introduction}

\section{The company}

My year in industry was spent abroad in Turkey at ILITRON Energy and Information Technologies
(known in Turkish as ILITRON Enerji ve Bilgi Teknolojileri).
The placement took place from June 2022 to May 2023, and was a hybrid of remote and on-site working.

Established in 2015, ILITRON engages in engineering research \& development,
with business solutions ranging from \gls*{iot} devices to autonomous robotic systems.
The company has recently shifted to developing robotic systems where
both hardware and software are engineered within the company.
ILITRON also works with and is partially funded by government research programs
from Turkey and the EU, and is currently focused on robotic hardware and software research.

At the start of the placement, the company only consisted of 10-15 employees.
The company received a major investment during my employment, causing it to expand rapidly,
with the company having employed 50+ people by the time my placement ended.
There was a notable shift in the work I did and the company culture during this period
which I go into detail in %[[Placement Report#Reflections|Reflections]].

\section{Expectations}

Prior to the placement, I was unsure of what career path I would want to walk through
after attaining my degree. The main objective I hoped to achieve in this placement was
to get a clearer understanding on the area of Computer Science I would like to pursue,
and whether research would be avenue I would be interested in.
I wanted to use this opportunity to try and broaden my current skill set and ability,
as at the time I did not see \gls*{ai} \& \gls*{ml} as viable career paths.
Despite being captivated by the topic, I had frequently brushed it aside due to
the (perceived) difficulty of the area.

This placement would be my first job primarily focused on programming,
which I hoped would allow me to apply theory I learnt in university,
and allow me to gain real-world experience on working in a professional environment.
This would also help further my employability post-degree,
and develop skills beneficial for the remainder of my studies.

Going into the placement, I was aware of the types of projects I would be working on,
including the research role I would begin with.
I had some expectation of furthering my \gls*{ai} knowledge beyond what I acquired in
my university modules, however I did not expect the extent of which it ended up being.
I also expected to work with colleagues across different areas of engineering.

\section{My Role}

The role I took within the company varied across the duration of the placement.
My primary role at the start of the placement was assisting in research and experimentation
for a research paper in progress. This involved me working with several colleagues across the globe
(both within the company and externally), presenting results and data to uncover insights.
This role was then expanded to further general software engineering responsibilities such as
web app development for an internal project management tool,
and robotics software development for robotic arm motion.

My general skills as a software engineer was also put into use when I was tasked to help
in authoring an AI-related project proposal for the EU's Horizon Europe funding programme
along with several other colleagues, requiring mocking up potential solutions
to the goal we were trying to achieve.

\section{Teams \& training}

During my time at ILITRON, I worked with several people across different areas of the company
for the projects I was working on. The expertise I was surrounded by ranged from other students
to electrical and embedded engineers to ML researchers.

The company provided e-learning courses and literature regarding the software and \gls*{ml} frameworks
I was to use, as well as the underpinnings of several mathematical concepts
the research paper was based around, including reinforcement learning algorithms and \gls*{ml} equations.

The remainder of this report will cover the key projects I participated in through the year
highlighting my contributions, and a reflection on my placement experience.
