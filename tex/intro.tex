\chapter{Introduction}

This document explains how to write a good report for your year in industry.
It is available in multiple forms:
\href{https://keats.kcl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=75967&section=27}{HTML embedded on Keats},
\href{https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/stephen.kell/yini/report-keats.html}{as a freestanding HTML page},
as part of a \href{https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/stephen.kell/yini/report.pdf}{template report in PDF format}
and in the \href{https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/stephen.kell/yini/reportsrc.zip}{LaTeX sources for that PDF}.
If you're using Word or something similar,
you can produce a complete template report
by copying the HTML in your browser and pasting it onto the end of the provided
\href{https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/stephen.kell/yini/report-word-frontmatter.docx}{Word template of front matter}.

The report is your chance to demonstrate the understanding that you have gained as a result of your
time on placement. That includes technical understanding, contextual understanding of that work's
place in the world, and understanding the relationships between your academic work and your
placement.

The report is \emph{not} expected to convey every technical aspect of the project or projects undertaken.
Its focus should be on your learning experience. However, the report is not a formality;
simply being able to state that you have spent the time on placement, and that your managers were
happy, does not amount to a successful placement year. The degree credit is awarded only if you can
produce a report that demonstrates the understanding you have gained.

Broadly, two different types of industrial placements can be distinguished. In one scenario, a
student is assigned to a project, which starts when the student joins the company and runs for the
entire time of the placement. In a more typical scenario, the student will experience a range of
projects, some to completion, but others only partially. These two types of placements will result
in a somewhat different report structure, but with a common outline, which is described in the next
section.
